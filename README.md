Simple Java program I made as exercise, including some JUnit 4 tests.

The program will draw three 5-card hands from a shuffled deck, and do analyzis on them. After analysis the program will print the hands and the hand type, if any. The supported poker hand types are two pairs, flush, straight, straight flush, and nothing.
